### Projects

- Added resistance in waves for monohull and catamaran (Personal Research)

  - Added resistance and ship motions of Wigley hulls and Delft-372 catamaran advancing in regular head waves were investigated using the RANS solver naoe-FOAM-SJTU; the relation between added resistance coefficient and wave parameters was investigated.

- Ship resistance of vessels with different hull forms (Group Leader)

  - Several conditions were considered (0.06<Fn<0.28); two draft conditions were calculated; the effects of different hull forms on resistance performance were studied, including bulb bow and dead wood; the error of resistance is less than 5%; 3D modeling, mesh generation, numerical computation, post processing, final report were completed. 

- Resistance and seakeeping performance of research vessels (Cooperative Investigator) 

  - The influences of special acoustic devices on flow field and resistance performance of research vessels in still water were studied; the motion and stability of the ship with bilge keel in beam sea conditions were simulated.

- Numerical simulation of the separation of oil and water in a tank (Principle Investigator)

  - Considered a portion of petroleum stored under a portion of water in a tank. The separating process of water and petroleum was simulated by OpenFOAM. The process of instilling petroleum and draining water was simulated.
